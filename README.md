- `/vault/retrieve` - Asset withdrawals
- `/vault/transactions` - Transaction history
- `/users` - User management
- `/settings` - Configuration management

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Customization
- **Colors**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` for custom color schemes
- **Themes**: Update CSS variables in `src/index.css`
- **Components**: Extend components in `src/components/`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## 📊 Performance
